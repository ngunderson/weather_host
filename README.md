# Host Device Sketch
This host sketch is directly responsible for listening for devices and forwarding the data onto the serial app (https://github.com/ngunderson/weather_serial). The serial app will then respond with an appropriate ACK if the device is recognized. Otherwise, a response will not be sent to the device.
